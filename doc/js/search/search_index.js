Install via ng add. (Recommended)\nNow add the library via the angular schematics\nng add ngx-linkifyjs2. Install via npm. (Alternative)\nNow install ngx-linkifyjs via:\nnpm i -s ngx-linkifyjs\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for ngx-linkifyjs:\n\n{\n  'ngx-linkifyjs';: 'node_modules/ngx-linkifyjs/bundles/ngx-linkifyjs.umd.js',\n}\nOnce installed you need to import the main module:\nimport { NgxLinkifyjsModule } from 'ngx-linkifyjs';The only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice NgxLinkifyjsModule .forRoot()):\nimport { NgxLinkifyjsModule } from 'ngx-linkifyjs';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [NgxLinkifyjsModule.forRoot(), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import NgxLinkifyjsModule:\nimport { NgxLinkifyjsModule } from 'ngx-linkifyjs';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [NgxLinkifyjsModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}\n\nUsage\nOnce the library is imported, you can use its components, directives and pipes in your Angular application:\nOptions\nngx-linkifyjs provides an appropriate option interface called NgxLinkifyOptions to access the native options of the linkifyjs library\nand all of them are optional\n\nDefault values\n\n\nimport { NgxLinkifyOptions } from 'ngx-linkifyjs';\n\n  const options: NgxLinkifyOptions =\n   {\n    attributes: null,\n    className: 'linkified',\n    defaultProtocol: 'http',\n    events: null,\n    format: function (value, type) {\n      return value;\n    },\n    formatHref: function (href, type) {\n      return href;\n    },\n    ignoreTags: [],\n    nl2br: false,\n    tagName: 'a',\n    target: {\n      url: '_blank'\n    },\n    validate: true\n  };Pipe\n{{text | linkify}}\nresult: Linkify the following URL: https://github.com/anthonynahas/ngx-linkifyjs and share it \nif you prefer to provide your own option to the pipe, you can use it like the following:\n\n{{text | linkify: 'options' }} \n{{text | linkify: '{/*your options*/}' }} \n{{text | linkify: '{target {url: \"_self\" }}' }}\n\nService\nInject the NgxLinkifyjsService service\nimport {NgxLinkifyjsService, Link, LinkType} from 'ngx-linkifyjs';\n\nconstructor(public; NgxLinkifyjsService;) {\n } \n}\n\nlinkify (text: string, options?: NgxLinkifyOptions): string\nConvert a basic text string to a valid linkified text\nParams\n\ntext : String Text to linkify --> to convert with links\noptions : NgxLinkifyjsService options to pass it to the linkifyjs library and it's optional\n\nReturns String  converted text with links\nimport {NgxLinkifyjsService, Link, LinkType, NgxLinkifyOptions} from 'ngx-linkifyjs';\n\nconstructor(public; NgxLinkifyjsService;) {\n\n  const options: NgxLinkifyOptions =\n     {\n      className: 'linkifiedYES',\n      target : {\n          url : '_self'\n        }\n      };\n\n  this.linkifyService.linkify('For help with GitHub.com, please email support@github.com');\n  // result 1 --> see below\n\n  this.linkifyService.linkify('For help with GitHub.com, please email support@github.com', options);\n    // result 2 --> see below\n } \n}result 1\n'For help with GitHub.com, please email support@github.com'result 2\n'For help with GitHub.com, please email support@github.com'find method\nFinds all links in the given string\nParams\n\ntext : String search text string\n\nReturns Array List of links where each element is a hash with properties type, value, and href:\n\ntype is the type of entity found.
